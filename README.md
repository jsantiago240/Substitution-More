# Substitution-2.0
This is a modified version of my submission for Harvard's edX cs50 course.
This version can cipher text the same way as the previous version but it also has the ability to decipher text as shown below:

Example 1:
  $ ./substitution2 cipher JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
  plaintext:    Hello World!!!
  ciphertext: 	Vkxxn Mnixe!!!
  
Example 2:
  $ ./substitution2 c JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
  plaintext:    Hello World!!!
  ciphertext: 	Vkxxn Mnixe!!!
 
Example 3:
   $ ./substitution2 Decipher JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
   ciphertext: 	Lvoz oz ekrocvkike lkwl!
   plaintext: 	This is deciphered text!

Example 4:
   $ ./substitution2 JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
   Usage: ./substitution [C]ipher/[D]ecipher key
